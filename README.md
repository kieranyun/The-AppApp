:bulb:  Made by Kieran Yun.

## How to access the API
simply open a terminal and try out the following cURL commands!

#### There are 5 routes available 
#### POST /registration 
   given a properly formatted JSON object, it will register a new user to the database. Post this route to add a user to the database, then post the next command to post an order by the newly made user. 
   
   ```
curl -d '{"customerID": "9999999","firstName": "Kieran",
"lastName": "Yun", "dob": "1993-09-04","city": "San Francisco", "country": "Nepal","countryCode": "NP","email": "fake.email1@gmail.com"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://54.177.197.187/registration
 ```
 
#### POST /orders
   given a properly formatted JSON object, it will register a new order to the database. The following link will work once, change the id to post another order. 
   
```
curl -d '{"orderID": "9999999","firstName": "Kieran",
"lastName": "Yun","email": "fake.email1@gmail.com","item": "Bespoke Applications"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://54.177.197.187/orders
 ```
   
#### GET /customers
   a get request to this endpoint will return a list of customers. It will return them a page at a time with optional query parameters page and count
   ```
   curl -X GET http://54.177.197.187/customers?page=2&count=10
   ```
#### GET /customers/:customerID
   if you have a customer's ID you can search for their info with this endpoint, replace the last subdirectory with any int between 1 and 1,000,000 for a random customer!
   ```

## Testing
The API is still very simple, it is missing validation and could use more elegant error handling!
